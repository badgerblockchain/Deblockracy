# Deblocracy
Badger Blockchain's democratic voting system for UW Madison ASM

## Plan
Alter [this](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/solidity-by-example.html) implementation of a voting strucutre, but figure out a way to integrate 'fake' student ID's into it. This will stand in place of the UW Net ID authentication step that we would use to authenticate voters.
